## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* #### _Your computer will need to have GIT installed._
* _If you do not currently have GIT installed you will need to follow the directions on GitHub's website for installing and setting up GIT. These can be found [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)_
* #### _Your computer will need to have Visual Studio Code installed._
* _You can download the program [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)_
* #### _Your computer will need to have Node installed._
* _You can learn how to download and install Node [here.](hhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)_


* _Once you have VSCode, Node, and GIT set up, you will need to open up your terminal and type the command:_
git clone https://github.com/ekthomas25/i-p-galactic-calculator.git

* _This will clone the repository to your desktop and you will be able to then open the folder in VSCode._
* _Open the terminal in VSCode and type the following command:_ npm install
* _This will install and generate the neccessary files for this project._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
